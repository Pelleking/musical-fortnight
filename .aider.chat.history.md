#### nara/src/component/search.tsx add inline tailwind styling  
> nara/src/component/search.tsx  
> Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  

I can see that the file already has Tailwind CSS classes applied to the input element. The current styling includes:
- `border-2` - 2px border
- `border-green-300` - green border color
- `rounded-m` - rounded corners (note: this should probably be `rounded-md`)
- `p-2` - padding
- `outline-none` - removes default outline

Could you clarify what additional styling you'd like me to add? For example:
- Different colors or sizing?
- Additional spacing or layout properties?
- Focus states or hover effects?
- Container styling around the input?

Or did you mean to fix the typo (`rounded-m` should be `rounded-md`)?

#### center the input field  

I will center the input field by adding flexbox centering classes to the container.

nara/src/component/search.tsx
```
function search() {
  return (
    <div className="flex justify-center items-center min-h-screen">
      <input placeholder='sök' className='border-2 border-green-300 rounded-md p-2 outline-none'/>
    </div>
  )
}

export default search
```

#### Add a search button on the bottom of the input  

I will add a search button below the input field by wrapping them in a flex column container.

nara/src/component/search.tsx
```
function search() {
  return (
    <div className="flex justify-center items-center min-h-screen">
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <input placeholder='sök' className='border-2 border-green-300 rounded-md p-2 outline-none'/>
        <button className='bg-green-500 text-white rounded-md p-2 hover:bg-green-600'>
          Sök
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default search
```

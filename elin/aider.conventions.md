# Aider Conventions
## Code Style
- Use clear and consistent naming.
- Follow camelCase for variables and functions.
- Use kebab-case for file names.
- Keep components small and focused.
## Structure
- Each component should be placed in its own folder when it grows large.
- Keep related files together (component, styles, and tests).
## Styling
- Use TailwindCSS for styling.
- Prefer using utility classes instead of custom CSS when possible.
## Accessibility
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA principles.
- Always include `alt` text for images.
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) must be accessible via keyboard.
## UX Basics
- Use clear and descriptive text for buttons and labels.
- Show a loading state during async actions.
- Display an empty state message when no results are available.
## Comments
- Add short comments only where logic might be unclear.
- Avoid unnecessary comments that repeat what the code already explains.
